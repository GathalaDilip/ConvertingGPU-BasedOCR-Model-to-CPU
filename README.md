# ConvertingGPU-BasedOCR-Model-to-CPU
Transitioning an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model from GPU to CPU allows for broader usability across devices with lower computational power. This process optimizes the model's performance while retaining accuracy, enabling text extraction without the need for high-end GPUs.
